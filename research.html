<h2>Preparation and characterization of Thermoelectric material</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Synthesized 6 layered thermoelectric material using solid state mechanisms in different external environments.</li>
	<li>Validated material characteristics using  X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high temperature X-ray diffraction and TG/DSC.</li>
	<li>Experimentally analyzed thermoelectric properties using LSR and LFA setups.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Molecular Dynamics of charged polymer chains</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Studied single chain polyelectrolytes and charged co-block polymer chains using molecular dynamics simulations. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Calculated sensitivity of physical and chemical properties of the polymer backbone (e.g. radius of gyration, end-to-end distance, ion condensation) to mechanical parameters like rigidity, dielectrics and salt concentration. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Gained expertise in molecular dynamics simulation using software packages like LAMMPS and VMD.
		
	</li>
</ul>
